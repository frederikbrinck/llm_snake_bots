# Vibecoded Multiplayer Snake Bot Arena

## Overview

Welcome to the Multiplayer Snake Bot Arena vibecoded with Claude 4.

Checkout the `backend/` folder for the main module.

You can also start the backend yourself with `cd backend/ && cargo run` and visit

* `localhost:3000/docs` for the documentation in a easily digestible web format
* `localhost:3000` for the game ui.

## Getting started vibing

To get started and use Claude 4 for free, I recommend you use [Zed](https://zed.dev/). Once installed:

* Tap `Cmd+Shift+P` to open the command palette
* Type `agent: new thread`
* Start vibing

Good luck building your sneaky snake bot!
